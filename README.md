## Tutorial

Ready to become a ClipMon pro? Let's dive in!

### Step 1: Start Basic Monitoring

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
python3 clipmon.py
```

ClipMon will now monitor your clipboard and save any valid URLs to `collected_clipboard.txt`.

### Step 2: Copy Some URLs

- Open your web browser.
- Copy a few URLs.
- Watch as ClipMon detects and logs them!

### Step 3: Use the SQLite Database Option

Want to store your clipboard content in a database? Use the `-db` option:

```bash
python3 clipmon.py -db my_clipboard.db
```

### Step 4: Export Your Data

After collecting data, you might want to export it:

```bash
python3 clipmon.py -dboutput my_clipboard.db exported_clipboard.txt
```

### Step 5: Capture All Clipboard Content

Need more than just URLs? Disable URL checking:

```bash
python3 clipmon.py -nourl
```

Now, every piece of text you copy will be recorded.

### Step 6: Stop Monitoring

- Simply press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
- ClipMon will gracefully stop and save all your data.

## Edge Cases

While ClipMon is designed to be robust, here are some edge cases to be aware of:

- **Non-Text Clipboard Content**: ClipMon only captures text data. Images, files, or other non-text content will be ignored.
- **Rapid Copying**: Copying content extremely rapidly may cause some entries to be missed due to the 1-second sleep interval. Adjust the sleep time in the script if necessary.
- **Database Integrity**: If using the database option, ensure the script has permission to write to the directory to avoid database errors.
- **Unicode Characters**: Clipboard content with unusual Unicode characters may cause unexpected behavior.

## FAQ

### Q1: Can I use ClipMon on Windows or Linux?

**A**: Currently, ClipMon is designed specifically for macOS due to its reliance on the `AppKit` framework. However, with some modifications, it could be adapted for other operating systems.

### Q2: How do I change the output file name?

**A**: By default, the script writes to `collected_clipboard.txt`. You can modify the script or use the database option to specify an output file during export.

### Q3: Is there a way to adjust the clipboard check interval?

**A**: Yes! In the script, you can modify the `time.sleep(1)` line to change the interval (in seconds) between clipboard checks.

### Q4: I'm getting a permission error when writing to the database. What do I do?

**A**: Ensure that the directory you're running the script in is writable. You might need to adjust the directory permissions or run the script from a different location.

### Q5: How can I contribute to the project?

**A**: We'd love your help! See the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.
